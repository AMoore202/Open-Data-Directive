# Ontario’s Open Data Directive 

Ontario’s Open Data Directive maximizes access to government data by requiring all data to be made public, unless it is exempt for legal, privacy, security, confidentiality or commercially-sensitive reasons. It sets out key principles and requirements for publishing open data, and applies to data created and managed by Ontario [ministries](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministries) and [provincial agencies](https://www.ontario.ca/page/agency-accountability).

## Introduction

The Government of Ontario promotes an Open by Default approach to the proactive release of Data.

This Directive outlines requirements for ministries and Provincial Agencies on listing all data inventories, publishing Open Data, and preparing information systems to support ongoing Open Data requirements.

The Open Data initiative supports government efficiency, effectiveness and innovation. Faster and easier access to Government Data through a one-window data portal facilitates evidence-based policy, informs service delivery and promotes greater transparency and accountability.

The Open Data initiative also supports public engagement and participation by allowing Ontarians to develop their own analysis, insights, and digital products.

To support this implementation of the directive, an Open Data Guidebook is available as a tool and resource to Ontario ministries and Provincial Agencies.

The Open Data Directive is a Management Board of Cabinet Directive, issued under the Management Board of Cabinet Act.

## Purpose

The purpose of this directive is to maximize access to Data by requiring that Government Data be Open by Default unless exempted from release in limited and specific circumstances as specified in this directive.

For the purpose of this directive, “Data” is defined as facts, figures and statistics objectively mea­sured according to a standard or scale, such as frequency, volumes or occurrences, but does not include Information (as defined by this directive).

This directive:
	
*	Instructs ministries and Provincial Agencies to release Government Data that they create, collect, and/or manage as Open Data, unless the Data is exempt from release as Open Data, pursuant to this directive.

*	Defines principles and requirements for publishing Government Data as Open Data.

*	Promotes a culture of openness and collaboration – both within the public service and externally with the people of Ontario.

## Application and Scope

This directive applies to all Ontario ministries and Provincial Agencies.

This directive applies to all Government Data.

This directive promotes Data Management practices which enable the proactive and ongoing release of Government Data and is to be implemented in a manner that is consistent with existing legal obligations, restrictions and requirements, including the Archives and Recordkeeping Act, 2006, the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, 1990, the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004, the French Language Services Act, 1990, and the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 or other applicable legislation.

## Principles

Government Data is Open by Default unless exempted from release in limited and specific circumstances as specified in this directive.

Personal Information is not to be released as Open Data under the terms of the Open Government Licence – Ontario. However, where there is sufficient statutory authority to release Personal Information, and where it is appropriate, Personal Information may be made available in a Machine-readable format.

Government ensures exempted Data remains secure and is managed responsibly.

When Government Data can be made available to the public, it will be released over the internet in an Open Format, at no charge to the user, and will be released under the Open Government Licence - Ontario (see Appendix A).

Open Data, to the fullest extent possible, is available in its original, unmodified form.

Government Data released as Open Data is accurate, timely, open access, interpretable coherent and primary as outlined in Appendix C: Data Quality Principles.

## Mandatory Requirements

The directive requires Government Data be Open by Default unless exempted from release in limited and specific circumstances as set out below:

* Data that is subject to statutory confidentiality requirements, (i.e. exempt from publication under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, 1990, the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004 and/or other statutes).

* Data that should not be disclosed for legal, security, confidentiality, privacy or commercial sensitivity reasons.

### Data Inventory

1. The Treasury Board Secretariat will establish, coordinate and maintain a comprehensive government-wide data Inventory. This government-wide data inventory will be published online and will be accessible to the public.

2. The Treasury Board Secretariat will identify common core Metadata elements and data standards, where applicable, to describe items listed in the inventory.

3. Each ministry and Provincial Agency must create an Inventory of Datasets within its custody and control.

4. Each ministry who has custody and control of Datasets must contribute to the government-wide data Inventory by providing to Treasury Board Secretariat a listing of all Datasets or categories of Data.

5. Provincial agencies must publish their Inventories in a new web page on their site or, in its absence, another government site in accordance with the Open Data Guidebook.

6. Ministries and Provincial Agencies are responsible for keeping their Inventory list up-to-date on an ongoing basis.

7. Ministries and Provincial Agencies must identify any Dataset which cannot be made accessible to the public as Open Data on its Inventory. In addition to identifying such Datasets, the ministry or Provincial Agency must provide a detailed explanation as to why the Dataset cannot be made accessible to the public as Open Data (e.g., exempt because of legislation, contains personal, confidential or commercially sensitive information, security, contains data for which Ontario does not have the necessary rights to make available as Open Data, etc.).

8. For each Dataset listed in the Inventory that can be made accessible to the public as Open Data, ministries and Provincial Agencies must identify in the Inventory, on an ongoing basis, if that Dataset will be released as Open Data.

9. In exceptional cases, ministries and Provincial Agencies may exclude a Dataset from their inventory where the organization is prevented from disclosing the Data by law or it is authorized by law to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of Data.

### Open Data Publication

1. All ministry Open Data must be made available in the Ontario Data Catalogue, which is a one-window central platform for all Open Data published by ministries and is administered by the Treasury Board Secretariat.

2. Provincial Agencies must publish all Open Data following Open Data requirements.

3. Ministries and Provincial Agencies must follow the Open Data Guidebook to ensure Government Data being released as Open Data meets required criteria.

4. Ministries and Provincial Agencies should prioritize the publication of Datasets frequently requested by the public, collected in support of government priorities or mandated by legislation (see Appendix B and Appendix D).

5. All Open Data must be released in an Open Format.

6. Open Data must be released at no charge to the user and under the Open Government Licence - Ontario (See Appendix A).

7. Ministries and Provincial Agencies must review and update Datasets released as Open Data periodically to ensure accuracy and timeliness.

8. No Datasets released as Open Data are to be deleted or removed from public access, except where a Dataset was published in error: 

    1. In situations where active maintenance and update of a Dataset is discontinued, or where any published Dataset has to be replaced with a newer or modified version, the Dataset description should be updated in the catalogue to reflect the “inactive” status, without restricting public ccess to the Dataset.

    2. Where custody and control for a Dataset is transferred from one program area to another program area, the new program area must update the Dataset description in the Ontario Data Catalogue to reflect this.

9. When legislation mandates the release of Data but does not specifically prescribe the format, ministries and Provincial Agencies should make best efforts to apply Open Data principles (i.e., listed in Ontario Data Catalogue, in an Open Format under the Open Government Licence - Ontario).

10. In cases where ministries and Provincial Agencies apply fees to process a request for Data, they must review the current practice to assess if releasing it as Open Data would be a more effective and efficient way of providing the Data. This does not apply to freedom of information requests made under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act application and processing fees or other fees authorized by or under statute.

11. Open Data is to be published in the Ontario Data Catalogue in the language it was collected. The dataset title, description, and all accompanying information must be available simultaneously in both English and French.
